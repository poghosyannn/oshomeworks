Ex1:
Different types have different alignments. Larger types are stored at addresses divisible by their size for faster access.

Ex2:
A padding is added between fields when we use structs, to keep alignment. Changing field order reduces wasted space.

Ex3:
#pragma pack(1) removes padding, making the struct smaller but possibly slower to access.
