Pointers
Assignment 1: Basics of Pointers
    Objective: Understand the basics of pointers, the address-of operator, and dereferencing.
    Task:
        Declare an integer variable and initialize it with a value.
        Declare a pointer variable that points to the integer.
        Print the address of the integer variable using both the variable and the pointer.
        Modify the value of the integer using the pointer and print the new value.

Assignment 2: Pointer Arithmetic
    Objective: Learn how pointer arithmetic works.
    Task:
        Declare an array of integers and initialize it with 5 values.
        Use a pointer to traverse the array and print each element.
        Modify the values of the array using pointer arithmetic.
        Print the modified array using both the pointer and the array name.
        
Assignment 3: Pointers and Functions
    Objective: Learn how to pass pointers to functions.
    Task:
        Write a function swap(int *a, int *b) that swaps two integer values using pointers.
        In the main() function, call swap() and pass the addresses of two integers.
        Print the values of the integers before and after the swap.

Assignment 4: Pointers to Pointers
    Objective: Work with double pointers.
    Task:
        Declare an integer variable and a pointer to that variable.
        Declare a pointer to the pointer and initialize it.
        Print the value of the integer using both the pointer and the double-pointer.

Assignment 5: Strings and Character Pointers
    Objective: Work with pointers to characters and string manipulation.
    Task:
        Declare a string as a character array: char str[] = "Hello";.
        Declare a pointer to the first character of the string.
        Print the string using the pointer and a loop (without using str[i]).
        Count the number of characters in the string using pointer arithmetic.
