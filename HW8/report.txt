Task 1:

Copies the content from one file to another using read() and write() functions. The first file
is opened in a read-only mode and the second file is opened in a write mode, with create/truncate
flags. At the end, the total number of bytes is printed.

Task 2:

Creates a file.txt data, then writes teh alphabet inside it. Then truncates it to the fist 10 
byes, using the ftruncate() function and prints the new size and the remaining content.

Task 3:

This program reads and prints a file’s content in reverse order. It uses lseek() to move backward
 one byte at a time and writes the characters in reverse to standard output.

Reads and prints a given file's content in reverse. Uses lseek() to move backward on each byte and writes
each charecter in reverse. 

Task 4:

Uses O_APPEND mode to append each entry log to the log.txt file, with the current process Id.
Then uses lseek() to show the resulting file offset.

Task 5:

Starts with writing "START", goes forward by 1 MiB, then writes "END", creating a 
sparse file that is large in logical size but which is small in actual disk usage.

Task 6:

Creates a file with numbers from 1 to 10 written on consecutive lines. Then replaces the fouth
line with "100" by reading the lines, modifying one of them, truncating the file and rewriting the
resulting content.

Task 7:

Opens and comapres two different files. If the files are identical, a message "The files are identical" is 
printed. If they are not, repors the first differin byte index.
