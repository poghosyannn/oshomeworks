Assignment 1:
The program starts three threads. Each thread prints a message showing that it is running. The main program waits for all threads to finish before exiting.
Assignment 2:
The array is split into two parts. Each thread calculates the sum of its own part. This shows how threads can work on different sections of the same data.
Assignment 3:
Three threads print numbers from 1 to 5. Since the threads run at the same time, the order of the numbers can change every time the program runs.
Assignment 4:
Each number in the array gets its own thread. Every thread prints the square of the number it receives. This shows simple parallel work where each thread does a small independent task.
